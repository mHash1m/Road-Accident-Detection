# Road Accident Detection
This project is a work in progress.
Please refer to Accident_Detection Notebook to know more about the Accident Detection approach.

### Problem Description
In a report of the World Health Organization (WHO), Approximately 1.35 million fatalities
occur during road accidents [1]. 93% of the fatality counts belong to low and middle-income
countries. This is because of the lack of awareness in people living in these countries on what to
do when a road accident occurs. This lack of awareness of the bystanders causes a delay in response to the victim,
which results in the loss of lives. 

If we could reduce this delay by detecting accidents automatically and sending the information 
of the accident to the traffic authorities or the nearest hospital, countless lives could be saved.

### Objectives
This project aims to build a system that can instantly detect any road accident occurrence from a
live feed of CCTV cameras. It will reduce the delay in providing medical aid to the victims of
road accidents by automatically detecting the accident and informing any relevant authorities
about it.

### Progress

- [x] Compile a data set from different sources (local vehicle data as well as coco data).
- [x] Annotate the data set in required format.
- [x] Build a model to perform obect detection on vehicles(including local vehicles) and people.
- [x] Perform object detection on the data set.
- [x] Build a system to detect road accidents.
- [x] Perform accident detection on dataset Videos.

## Instructions to Run
To be added once the project is completed and can be set up easily.
