# Road Accident Detection
This project is a work in progress.

### Problem Description
In a report of the World Health Organization (WHO), Approximately 1.35 million fatalities
occur during road accidents [1]. 93% of the fatality counts belong to low and middle-income
countries. This is because of the lack of awareness in people living in these countries on what to
do when a road accident occurs. This lack of awareness causes a delay in response to the victim,
which results in the loss of lives. 

The main reason for road accidents having a high death rate is in fact delay in medical aid. 
This delay is mainly caused by the lack of response from the bystanders or authorities. 
If we could reduce this delay by detecting accidents automatically and sending the information 
of the accident to the traffic authorities or the nearest hospital, countless lives could be saved.

### Objectives
This project aims to build a system that can instantly detect any road accident occurrence from a
live feed of CCTV cameras. It will reduce the delay in providing medical aid to the victims of
road accidents by automatically detecting the accident and informing any relevant authorities
about it. These pings will accompany a short video clip of the incident. The project will also
focus on accuracy optimization, i.e. reducing the number of false positives and false negatives.

### Progress
The project is still under development and experimentation. Each of the checked tasks are constantly
being improved while we proceed with the next tasks.

- [x] Compile a data set from different sources.
- [x] Annotate the data set in required format.
- [x] Build a model to perform obect detection on vehicles(including local vehicles) and people.
- [ ] Perform object detection on the data set, in real-time.
- [ ] Build a system to ideally detect road accidents in real-time.
- [ ] Perform accident detection on dataset streamed in real-time.
